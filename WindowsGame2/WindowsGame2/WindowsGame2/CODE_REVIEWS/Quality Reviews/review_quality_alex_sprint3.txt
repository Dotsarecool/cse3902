+ The class is nice and small and has better cohesion now that it doesn't contain the Position and Velocity of it's parent object

- The hitbox is being set to the same thing in both the constructor and the update method, which could possibly be factored out as common code.

This class is good because if we wanted to change how mushrooms worked, we wouldn't have to change much if anything in this class.
