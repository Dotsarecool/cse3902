+ The class has high cohesion as it does what it is supposed to do and nothing more.
- variables frame, lag, and counter are unused.

A hypothetical change that we could do in the future is change the game sprites to costruct a new game,
this class is generic enough that we could easily use it to dispense a random powerup or item without
changing anything else but the sprite. Also the animation would have to be changed, but the the animation
class would handle that.
